 > How to Play

Press start, enter your name, and choose whether or not you'd like to play aggro.

You will be presented with an endless amount of enemies for you to battle.

Select "check" to check either yourself or your enemy.
Checking the enemy displays their stats and ability (debuff)
Checking yourself displays your stats, score, and enemies killed

Select "item" to go to the item use menu.
Choosing an item will cause that item to be "selected"
You can also press "cancel" at the item use screen to set the selected item to "null" (no item selected)
The selected item will be used when the turn ends, BEFORE damage is dealt.

Select "fight" to end the turn. When this happens, the following will happen in order:
- Enemy debuff is applied (chance)
- Item is used
- User attacks enemy
- Enemy attacks User
- Buffs and Debuffs are reset

The goal of the game is to defeat as many enemies as possible. The game ends when you lose or quit.

 > Note

All values (such as attack, defense, heal amount, etc.) are subject to change as the games gets playtested for balance issues.

 > What does aggro mean?

Entities with aggro have more attack than defense, while entities without aggro have more defense than attackk.

Name, Ability (debuff), Aggro (y/n), Description

Sir Skeleton, confused, y, Used to be a biology professor specializing in the nervous system. Goes hysterical if you don't address him as "sir".
Hemogoblin, bleed, n, Bloody little rascals that want to steal your gold and your blood. Fortunately, there is no gold in this game.
Old Lunatic, confused, y, Used to be an adventurer like you, but lost sight of what was important. Now aimlessly roams the dungeons while talking to himself.
Headless Horseless Horseman, deficient, y, Lost his head, and his horse. Now has nothing but a jack-o-lantern and a huge axe.

Business Zombie, weakened, y, Says he just wants to do business, but really only wants your brains.
King Cobra, poisoned, y, Refuses to be called anything but "King", but has no subjects. Constantly in denial.
Common Slime, null, n, The easiest enemy. Many consider it an honor to meet them, so try not to get too excited.
Lost Pirate, bleed, y, Isn't supposed to be here. Perhaps he came looking for treasure and never found a way out?
The Nerve, confused, y, Used to be a biology professor specializing in the skeletal system. Just wants to be left alone by those pesky Business Zombies.
Arachne, frozen, n, Doesn't disturb you if you don't disturb her. Clearly, you must have disturbed her.
Purple Guy, bleed, y, Serial killer obsessed with the color purple. Weakness is a combination of water and poorly designed fursuits.
